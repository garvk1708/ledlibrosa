# ledlibrosa
This project integrates an ESP8266 microcontroller with a Flask web application that utilizes the Librosa library for audio analysis. The goal is to create an interactive LED system that responds to audio characteristics in real-time. By analyzing audio signals, the system can control the state of an LED, turning it on or off based on specific criteria, such as tempo.
